## Introduction

If you don't know already, Raycast is a launcher similar to other apps such as Alfred, Monarch, and the default Spotlight Search. It provides a simple user interface for launching apps, searching for files, searching through websites, and more. I've personally chosen it over Alfred due to its more elegant design, action panel <b>(Cmd + K = yay!)</b>, and its more generous free tier.

As a web developer and student, I've found it very useful for many things, and it's honestly replaced a lot of tools and brought many features over from Windows that I used (specifically that were found in PowerToys). In fact, when choosing a laptop, Raycast was one of the reasons I opted for a Mac over a Windows laptop. It's truly essential for my workflow, and there is nothing that can come even remotely close to it on Windows.

## My Most Used Default Features

- Clipboard history - this is a no-brainer, especially coming from Windows, considering how useful it is to easily access multiple items. I've recently changed the hotkey to <b>Option + Shift + V</b> to preserve the paste without formatting hotkey <b>(Cmd + Shift + V)</b>.
- File Search - I've set an alias of <b>F</b> for this, making it really easy to access; pretty straightforward.
- System Commands - Mostly just using the Sleep Command. As someone who likes to keep their Mac on a desk for most of the day, I want to preserve the hinge, so using this command is super convenient. I've set it as a favorite, so I can easily access it through <b>Cmd + Space</b> then <b>Cmd + 1</b>.
- Emoji Search - Sometimes useful; just nice to be able to search directly from Raycast.
- Focus - This is a newer feature, but one of my favorites. I love being able to block websites and apps using this feature, and it works; the Pomodoro feature works great since it displays the time as a live activity on your menu bar.
- Launching Apps (duh).
- Searching within websites.
- Opening Websites.
- Floating Notes (found this useful for displaying simple to-do lists while working and using it as a temporary place to dump text).
- My Schedule - I love how it makes it really easy to join meetings, probably one of the most subtle yet useful features in Raycast for me personally.

## Extensions

The extension store is really where Raycast starts to get more advanced and replace more niche tools. Here are some of my most used extensions:

- Add to Dropover
- Apple Mail

- Count

- <a href="../projects/sportssync" aria-label="Sportssync Project Page" target="_blank">Sportssync (made by me!)</a>
- Spotify Controls
- Raytyping
- System Monitor
- Test Internet Speed
- Todoist
- Toothpick
- Vercel

I've found Color Picker and Recognize Text to be really useful while doing web development, especially since they were features found in PowerToys that I used on Windows.

Shortcuts Search is useful for learning shortcuts in apps, but I've never really gotten in the habit of using it.

Set Audio Device and Toothpick work great together to manage Bluetooth audio devices.

Spell, Dictionary, and Count are really useful and work great together while creating blog posts and writing.

I've chosen to use Raytyping over the default typing extension since it doesn't have punctuation, which I find annoying while practicing my typing.

## Quicklinks and Snippets

Quicklinks is probably my most used feature of Raycast. I don't use browser bookmarks, but I really love Quicklinks. Some of my most common uses have been opening course trackers and Google Classrooms, which significantly speeds up my workflow. I also have Quicklinks set up to open things like my portfolio website, Gmail, web docs, and other tools that I use. I've also set up querying for Google Docs, Slides, Drive, YouTube, npm, MDN, etc.

I've never really found text expansion to be useful. I get the appeal of using it for longer pieces of text, but I've never found a use case for me. It feels annoying since I have to remember what I set the trigger to, and most of the time I just have to go and search for the snippet, which just takes longer. However, I have found it useful to store things like mathematical symbols and icons (like the copyright icon) and then later search for them. It's much easier and faster than doing it manually through Google.

## Window Management

Raycast is great as a window management system; it has everything you need out of the box for a keyboard-based system. This is my current setup that I use with both a 13-inch Mac and a 24-inch monitor:

- Center - <b>Cmd + Shift + Up</b>
- First Third - <b>Cmd + Option + Shift + Left</b>
- First Two Thirds
- Last Third
- Last Two Thirds - <b>Cmd + Option + Shift + Right</b>
- Left Half - <b>Cmd + Shift + Left</b>
- Maximize - <b>Cmd + Option + Shift + Up</b>
- Next Desktop
- Next Display - Alias: <b>Next</b>
- Previous Desktop
- Previous Display - Alias: <b>Prev</b>
- Restore - <b>Cmd + Shift + Down</b>
- Right Half - <b>Cmd + Shift + Right</b>

## General Tips and Tricks

- Many people already know that you can skip a song in Spotify by closing and reopening the app. However, using Raycast, we can speed this up. Search for the Spotify app, and using the hotkey: <b>Control + Shift + R</b>, you can easily restart the app.

- If you're using compact mode (which I personally recommend), you can add commands and apps as favorites and access them by typing <b>Cmd + Space</b>, then <b>Cmd + 1</b> - <b>9</b> (depending on how many favorites you have). Note: You will have to check "Show Favorites" in compact mode for this (it's under General).
- Select "Show Raycast on Screen Containing Mouse" for the most convenience while working.
- If you take screenshots of the Raycast window (specifically for developers), you can set a custom wallpaper that is used. This is especially for taking screenshots of your extensions.
- You can set up hotkeys to launch apps directly, without having to open Raycast. For example, I've set up <b>Cmd + Space</b> to open ChatGPT, <b>Control + Shift + S</b> for Safari, and <b>Control + Shift + L</b> for Localsend.
- When searching for files, if you search for a folder and then press <b>Tab</b>, you can search within the folder.
- Set the max amount of results to the lowest setting for faster search (in my experience, it's still fine for finding results).
- Disable as many commands, extensions, and applications as possible for a less cluttered and more productive workflow (remember just things you don't need to access or don't use).

## Conclusion

If you're a Mac user and you're looking to improve your workflow, you can't go wrong with Raycast. It's a great app with an amazing developer team that has been great at listening to its community and implementing high-quality and well-thought-out features.
