- **Tracker Command:** A command to view injuries and transactions.
- **Past Scores Command:** A separate command (or something integrated into the scores and schedules command) to allow users to view scores for previous games (up to a few days).
- **Additional Leagues:** Please request any leagues that you'd like me to add support for, and I'll look into seeing what I can do.

_In-depth stats, for the scores and schedule command:_
